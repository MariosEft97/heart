### Project: Heart

In the current project Machine Learning techniques were exploited in order to predict which people are more at risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) or myocardial infraction (MI).

The following classification techniques were used:
- Extreme Gradient Boosting
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Gausian Naive Bayes
- Bernoulli Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost

The technique retrieving the highest accuracy on the train data was used to make predictions on the test data.
